# Privacy Policy — MY Food Cart V2

**Effective date:** January 22, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **MY Food Cart V2** (“the App”) collects, uses, stores, and shares information.

## Who this app is for
The App is designed for business use (e.g., food cart operations) by authorized users (such as managers, clerks, and staff). It is not intended for children.

## Information we collect
The App may collect and store the following data, depending on how you use it:

### 1) Account & profile information
- User name (if provided)
- Role (e.g., general manager, operation manager, inventory clerk, developer)
- PIN (used for app access)
- Optional profile photo (if you choose to add one)

### 2) Business data you enter
- Inventory items, quantities, pricing, and categories
- Sales entries (date, totals, optional details)
- Expense entries (date, totals, optional details)
- Activity/history logs (e.g., actions performed in the app)

### 3) Device permissions (only when you use related features)
- **Camera / Photos:** used to add a profile photo (if you choose).
- **Storage access:** used for local app data storage and file handling on your device (if applicable).
- **Microphone:** the App does **not** use the microphone to record audio in normal operation. If your device shows a microphone permission prompt, it may be due to system/media components; you can deny it and continue using core features.

## How we use information
We use the collected information to:
- Provide app functionality (inventory, sales, expenses, summaries)
- Authenticate users and enforce roles/permissions
- Save your data locally on the device so the app can work offline
- Synchronize data to your cloud database when sync is enabled (see below)

## Sync and cloud storage (Supabase)
If you configure cloud sync, the App transmits your app data to your Supabase backend (database and storage) so it can be backed up and available across devices. Supabase acts as a service provider/processor for data you choose to sync.

## Sharing of information
We do **not** sell your data.
We share data only:
- With your configured Supabase backend for syncing (if enabled by you), and
- When required to comply with applicable law.

## Data retention
- Local data remains on your device until you delete it, reset the app, or uninstall the app.
- Synced data remains in your Supabase project until you delete it from your database/storage.

## Security
- The App stores data locally (including offline use).
- We use reasonable measures to protect data; however, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
- You are responsible for securing devices that have access (PIN control, device lock, etc.).

## Your choices
- You can choose not to provide optional fields (like profile photo or optional details).
- You can manage your business data by editing/deleting entries inside the app.
- If you want data removed from cloud sync, you must delete it from your Supabase project.
